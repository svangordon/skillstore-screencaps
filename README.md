# skillstore-screencaps
SkillStore was a soft skills training SaaS app that incorporated video chat using the OpenTok WebRTC API. I worked on the front end to develop interactive video conferencing features. I was very proud of how I was able to come up to speed quickly on new technologies and overcome some obstacles that had been delaying the project for months. I worked extensively using ES6, React, and Redux.
